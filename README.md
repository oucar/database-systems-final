## Overview
- This project is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It serves as a platform for managing projects within a software development company. Users can create new projects, assign project managers and employees, add technology stacks, upload project images, and collaborate on project changes.

## Personal Thoughts
- Undertaking this project has been not only a test of technical skills but also a journey of personal growth and learning. While initially faced with challenges in setting up the environment and integrating authentication systems, the decision to pivot to the MERN stack proved instrumental in overcoming these obstacles. The process of building this full-stack application has instilled in me a deep understanding of modern web development practices and technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Through persistence and dedication, I was able to deliver a robust application that fulfills all project requirements, earning a **perfect score of 100%**. This achievement not only validates the effort and dedication invested but also serves as a testament to the continuous pursuit of excellence in software development. This project has not only enriched my technical skillset but has also bolstered my confidence in tackling complex challenges head-on.

## Key Features
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD functionality for projects
- Search functionality for projects by name, employees, and technology stack
- Changelog for project collaboration
- Integration with MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data storage
- Integration with Google authentication for user login

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing project data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building the server-side API.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for running server-side code.
- **Material UI**: A React UI framework for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A library for making HTTP requests from the client to the server.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **Redux**: A state management library for React.js applications.
- **BcryptJS**: A library for securely hashing passwords.
- **Mongoose**: An ORM for MongoDB, used for connecting the server to MongoDB Atlas.
- **React-file-base64**: A library for converting images to base64 format.
- **react-google-login**: A library for authenticating with Google.

## Challenges Faced
- Rewriting authentication logic for Google authentication integration.
- Learning to store images as base64 format on MongoDB Atlas.
- Overcoming challenges with implementing a "Similar Projects" feature.

## Final Thoughts
Building this project provided valuable learning experiences in working with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Overcoming challenges such as authentication integration and cloud-based data storage has resulted in a functional application that can be added to the portfolio.
